Browser-based 3D CAD fun (hobby project)

The far-visioned and far-off goal of Kwente is to build a browser-based CAD system using mr. doob's three.js

The focus of Kwente (so far) was to play with implementing a parametric solver. This code is therefore on the quick'n'dirty side, with any real testing being conducted in Firefox. The object modeling may not be the optimal for parametric solving. In short, there's a lot to do. That happens when a personal project gets more light than originally intended :)
